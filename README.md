# Emaily
Application to send email surveys to a given list of emails. For the Udemy Course 'Node with React: Fullstack Web Development'

## Note on Commits
This app has a ton of commits in it. When I'm doing Udemy courses I like to commit after almost every video.
This course goes through tons of details on 5-6 lines of code at a time, so the commits are generally not going to be big
